About
Space Adventure is an arcade style game where you dodge falling asteroids using the left and right arrow keys. You can collect hearts and fuel on your journey to outer space, but be careful, if you fuel gauge depletes your ship will explode and it’s game over! Another way to lose the game is to run out of hearts on the way up. You lose hearts by asteroids hitting your ship.

Running the game
The main file to run the game is located in mainMenuView.java, there are two ways to run the game. One way is to run the mainMenuView.java file through an IDE like intelliJ, the other method is to run the spacegame.jar file located in /spacegame/out/artifacts/spacegame_jar. The .jar method is standalone and does not require an IDE to execute.

Bugs and issues
There are no major bugs. One slight issue is that high scores are not persistent across games. Therefore, the high score tracker only allows you to compare to how you’ve done during a specific session.
